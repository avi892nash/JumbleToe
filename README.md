# JumbleToe ðŸŽ²âœ¨  
*A fresh twist on classic Tic-Tac-Toe!*  

JumbleToe is a unique variant of Tic-Tac-Toe where the usual Xâ€™s and Oâ€™s are shuffled instead of being played in a strict turn-based manner. Each player is assigned a specific symbol, and the challenge is to form three in a row before the opponent does.  

## ðŸ”¥ Features  
- **Shuffled Symbols:** The number of Xâ€™s and Oâ€™s are randomized before each game.  
- **Assigned Characters:** Players must strategize using their given symbol.  
- **Classic Mechanics, New Challenge:** Familiar gameplay with a fresh competitive edge.  
- **Multiplayer Mode (Coming Soon! ðŸš€)**
